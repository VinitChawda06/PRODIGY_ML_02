# Customer Segmentation Using K Means Clustering

## Description
This project aims to perform customer segmentation using the K Means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation is a technique used in marketing to group customers based on similarities, enabling businesses to customize their strategies and offerings for each segment effectively.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install the required packages using the following command:

```python
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Follow the steps below to use this project:

1. Download the dataset file "Mall_Customers.csv" and place it in the same directory as the script.
2. Import the required libraries in your Python environment.
3. Run the code provided to perform the following tasks:
   - Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis, including data visualization using violin plots, box plots, and bar plots.
   - Apply K Means clustering algorithm to perform customer segmentation.
   - Visualize the clusters in a 3D scatter plot.

## Results
After executing the code, you will obtain the following results:

- Violin plot: Visual representation of the frequency distribution of ages.
- Box plots: Visualization of spending score and annual income distribution.
- Bar plots: Distribution of customers by gender, age groups, spending scores, and annual incomes.
- Elbow plot: Shows the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) for different values of K, helping to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- 3D Scatter Plot: Visualizes the customer segmentation based on age, annual income, and spending score.
